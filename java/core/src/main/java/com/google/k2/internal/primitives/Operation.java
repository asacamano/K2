/**
 * An {@link Operation} performs simple or complex cryptographic operations given keys and
 * input data.
 *
 * <p>Specifically, operations describe two things:
 * <ol>
 * <li>composition of cryptographic primitives - for example, both encrypting and applying an HMAC
 * <li>structure of messages - for example a key ID prefix, an IV, ciphertext, and an HAMC
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>For example, an operation might be as simple as calculating a hash, or it might be as complex
 * as doing session key generation, encrypting the key using an asymmetric key, signing a structured
 * message containing the encryption key id and the raw data, encrypting the structured message and
 * its signature with the session key, appending an HMAC to the entire message, and then prefixing
 * it with some signals specifying the format and type of the message.
 *
 * <p>In general, any method on an Operation should be safe to call from multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>An Operation must define (and follow) a message structure as a list of {@link MessageField}
 * objects. At most one {@link MessageField} may be of type {@link MessageFieldType#BYTES_VARIABLE}
